You don't need to format your answers in any special way. The AI understands conversational language:
- ✅ "About 2 days, maybe 6 hours each day"
- ✅ "I'm thinking a weekend workshop, Saturday and Sunday"
- ✅ "Two full days with breaks"

#### Clarifying Questions
If your answer needs more detail, the AI might ask follow-up questions:
- "That sounds great! Can you share what specific skills participants will gain?"
- "Interesting! Could you tell me more about the hands-on activities?"

#### Building on Previous Answers
The AI remembers your previous responses and may reference them:
- "Since you mentioned small business owners, what specific marketing challenges do they face?"
- "Given the 2-day format, how will you structure the content across both days?"

### Generating Your Document

Once all questions are answered, the tool will:
1. Process all your responses

## Best Practices

### Be Specific
The more detailed your answers, the better your workshop plan:
- Instead of: "Marketing skills"
- Try: "How to create Facebook ad campaigns that convert at 3%+"

### Think About Your Audience
Always answer with your ideal participant in mind:
- What do they already know?
- What do they struggle with?
- What would excite them?

### Include Practical Elements
Workshops are about doing, not just learning:
- Mention hands-on exercises
- Include real-world examples
- Plan for participant interaction

### Consider the Flow
Think about how topics build on each other:
- Start with foundational concepts
- Progress to more advanced topics
- End with implementation planning

## Troubleshooting

### If the AI Asks for Clarification
This is normal and helpful! Simply provide more detail:
- Original: "Email marketing"
- Clarified: "Setting up automated email sequences for product launches"

### If Document Generation Takes Too Long

- If it takes longer than 5 minutes, refresh the page and try again
- Your previous answers are saved, so you won't lose progress
