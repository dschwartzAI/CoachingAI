## Introduction & Welcome

Hey! Peeps. I seem to have zoom open twice. I don't even know how that's possible, but it's working. Just wait a minute while you'll roll in. I'll drop the usual in the chat. It's about the dock and this one is going to expand as we go along, so add add some ads and other things as we go along, because it's a pretty dynamic dynamic funnel. So the daily client machine how's that for size? The the font. Good. I know these Google docs are good, good, good. So.

Jim Tyrrell: Good enough.

James Kemp: Good enough, that's all we need. So daily flight machine coming up to coming up to 7 years old in terms of in terms of a concept and the market is kind of the same and kind of different in many ways. But what hasn't changed is that, you know, market dynamics are exactly that the distribution of a market is exactly that so client serving businesses are set up to serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace won't become a client. and over a long enough time period. If we quote unquote nurture people long enough and stay consistent, then clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. And what you find is that on average people will, you know. turn one to 5% of their audience. you know, and that's a broad metric into a client. So you know, you get a thousand people. You get a thousand leads, and you know, over time you get 10 to 30 clients out of a pretty common ratios. And there's 2 issues with this that it's really inefficient. If you're not selling to 990 or 970 people that you've, you know, got the attention of, captured the details off and got the permission to talk to. Then that's you know it's a large portion of wastage.

## The Problem with Long Sales Cycles

and the other factor is that there is no determinant of how long it's going to take. I've had scenarios where I've generated a lead 5 years ago before someone did that. If that was a planned sales cycle, then fine. I'm not a real estate agent, and you know I'd like it to be a little bit shorter. Long sales. Cycles are very hard to scale. and so to get things to grow or to have control over something. We need something that is scalable because scale is a byproduct of, you know, control. If we want to scale something up, we have to have control over something that works. And if we want to scale something down, we have to have the control over it as well. So we must have efficient ways to to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible. plus. It's useful to generate cash along the way as you invest to grow anything we need to invest, we need to invest time, or we need to invest money. We need to invest energy in both of those. And so as we go along, it's useful to generate cash flow from the energy that we put into our content our marketing, our lead generation, our advertising and everything in that category. And the power ladder is, you know, undefeated that one to, you know, for most people 3% is kind of the number one to 3% of people in your audience, become a client, and will give you large amounts of money and will agree to have a level of transformation. There are people who just get coaching get mentorship do that consistently over long periods of time. They value being in proximity to people who are doing similar things to them. And they understand that. That's how you actually progress. It's much less about the things you do. It's about the people you're around

---

## Audience Segmentation & Lead Generation

coming down from that. There are people who will invest intermittently. You know. They might buy a program here, an event here, a short coaching course, here a mastermind, and come into a free period and come out. Those people, you know, are there. They are valuable to you, and you are valuable to them on the journey, you know, and I see a lot of people kind of going and talking, or being coached by one of my friends, and then coming back to me, and then going away again to do something else. And and they we don't have a linear path, but they are in my world for months and years. and then we have everybody else who will buy things spasmodically. They'll buy things occasionally, or they'll buy one thing and never buy another thing. But they might stick around in your audience, and there might be people who a big advocate of you I've got. I can think of lots of scenarios and people who fit these kind of criteria. And so traditional lead generation has just been a game of large numbers, you know, feed a thousand people on the top, nurture them while each one drops off. Get 30 clients at the other end if you could. and it's pretty wasteful, and it's pretty inefficient, and over time as we're seeing now. And you know a lot of people, especially if you're selling money or transformation fitness coaching as well. It's just harder because there's more people doing it. There's more, there's more cynicism, there's more blindness in the market, and it's just harder to to. It's harder to get clients. It's harder to capture attention. It's harder to differentiate. And over time no systems that waste most of their output have actually stood the test of time.

---

## The Dual-Mode Funnel Concept

And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, you know, download a lead magnet, and you know, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, like people, are always looking for the best funnel. And you know, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together. So dual mode client generation is a singular idea, deployed in in the same funnel with 2 different funnel types. So what we really want is clients, right? We can use those who won't immediately become clients to fund our marketing to get clients. That's the I think it's a little bit of a black pill. That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you like. There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients. And what we really want is that the efficient way to do that? So this funnel monetizes IP that we've already got, we can use those who who won't immediately become clients to fund the acquisition of them, and we shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness of prospects.

---

## Two Buying Types: Insight vs. Info

So in a dual mode funnel we generate leads and customers, at the same time using the same idea, so that this is not which one is best. They both serve roles right? The traditional Vsl based funnel that generates a lead and gives someone some insight has a place the more modern. You know, low ticket info buying products leading to a place has a place one isn't better than than the other. In certain circumstances, you know, for for certain people one will outperform the other one, but they both have a role, and by using both at once we get the best of both worlds. So to understand why. you know which is important to me that you understand why these things actually work, you know, below the strategic level is that there are lots of different ways that people buy stuff. Right? So I've identified 2 buying types that they both. you know, fundamentally work on the same premise. We need people to consume our ideas and us to buy into them. Right? We need to sell people ideas before we sell them anything we need to people to buy into our ideas, to buy into working with us, and the key word, and which is not often used in the design and deployment of, you know, lead generation and funnels is consume because one path a buyer can take is consuming information, deriving insight on how it could work for them. Then, taking the next step to put the insight into action. the other is purchasing information consuming it. Then taking the next step presented in the chain. So I gave an example recently where I had bought, quote unquote high ticket services from 2 different people in 2 different ways, one by going through a traditional funnel and watching some information and then reaching out to them, and the other by buying their products, consuming the contents of the products. And then, you know, taking the next step and engaging their services right? Both of these types of consumption have a have different advantages. Free information has a distribution advantage putting content out on the Internet.

---

## The Power of a Singular Idea in Dual Modes

It's more likely to be consumed than it is. If it's behind a paywall paid information has attention and attention advantage. If people pay, they tend to pay attention right? And so putting information and insight in front of people using both at the same time, is the force multiplier. And this, you know, gets above that. What is the one funnel. There isn't 1 funnel. There is understanding the principles behind, a singular idea, being deployed and deploying it in different modes. So the Dcm 2.0 deploys both at the same time. and we create the same. We take the same idea and create 2 funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer. The client. Funnel uses an insight path. So consumption of information, and the customer funnel uses an info path. Purchasing and consuming information right? So as always, it's much simpler to show you rather than tell you so. One of the things that is the most challenging with offers right when we're making offers is what precedes the offer? What happens around the offer that you're making? And we, you know, when we look at Google Docs, we often look at the the offer. That's inside the Google Doc. But we need to understand what's happened before that. And we also need to understand what's happened after it as well. That's my, both my zooms going off at once. So the client funnel works with both organic content and paid traffic right? So the top of the funnel we have content and pre-selling content is about 2 different things. It's about consistency and understanding that there's only really 3 content types that we're putting out there. So pre-selling content does exactly that. It pre-sells them on. What can happen next. So the content types are our mechanisms, you know. I will talk about the hybrid offer. I will show how it works. I'll give different examples to it. I will talk about the daily client machine. I'll show how it works. I'll give different examples to it.

---

## Content Strategy & World Building

This pre-sells people on the ideas that these things work and gives them insight that it might work for them right? And so the other top content types are, you know, the identity I talk about the sovereign consultant. I talk about the sovereign components and and the process, and especially with video based content. You are showing those things as well rather than just telling right? So where are you? What is the background? What world are you in. What's your philosophy? Who's around you? What is the day in the life, what is behind the scenes? Who are the characters? If you're on a refresher on those things, then it's in the authority training in the, in the membership. So the world building is. you know, the things around you, and though they can be, you know, stories like, I do, you know, stop marketing, start demonstrating as me, just talking about my experience and pointing something out and giving inside philosophy online coaching is dead. But there's lots of things that are more mechanistic here as well. That content, you know, if we're doing it from a content way, then funnels them to a big idea. Video. And this is for all intents and purposes of Vsl. I don't call it a Vsl, because I have found. There's no actual formula that applies to each individual. There are particular formulas that apply to certain categories. If you're just selling coaching, there's a particular formula for that. If you're just selling agency, there's a particular formula for a Vsl that works really well, and a lot of those Vsls to be honest work very well in call funnels, but less well in insight funnels. So I frame my, you know, big idea as essentially a demo.

---

## Creating Your "Big Idea" Video (VSL)

a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit. So one of the key things here is, use the style that's native to you. My style is, I will formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver on my training. I'll formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver offers. And I'll formulate a Google Doc to also, you know, use in my marketing. So a Google, Doc is native to the way that I work and the way I present, and the way I think. And so it's the native thing for me. I have a friend who uses, you know, slides because that's how he does it. And he, you know, draws on paper, and he draws on an ipad. I have a friend who goes piece straight to camera with no, you know. no props or anything like that, because that's how he does it, and that's how he delivers. And that's how his training work. So the net the native style is. you know, is is native to you. For me, it's Google Docs, one of the dirty secrets about big ideas or Vsls, the headline drives 50% of the conversion. We only really need people to watch a couple of minutes of something to get them to take action, because the headline has framed whether they are interested and whether it's relevant to them at exact. At that exact time a lot of testing in these funnels goes back to the media, whereas the headline is the you know the thing that it says at the top of the page actually drives most of the the attention and the activity off the back of it.

---

## Driving Conversations & Case Studies

The the thing we're looking for is no more than a couple of minutes of consumption. And a big idea Video, if you've introduced it, and you've got the gist. Then people, you know, can can actually get enough of the idea. There is at the start. We want to put a lot of volume through a big idea video. So when I launch one of these videos, I just have a button there which enables people to start chatting with me straight away. I want to have conversations with people. I'm not gonna automate anything. I'm not gonna put anything in the way to actually you know. try and qualify, or anything like that. I just want to talk to people. Who are they? Why do they click it? Where are they now? Am I useful to them. And the the other major point is, use the messaging platform that's native to you. I used to use Facebook and like Facebook messenger when when I get people to reach out. I'm barely on Facebook these days, so it would be a mistake to use it. So I send people to an Instagram chat. Or I can send people to email as well, which tends to be my preference. Preference these days. So I'm you know, essentially, I've I've this this video. Here was 44 min. I've got another one. That's 11. These worked for me because they're in their native format. Excuse me. then, we're, you know, giving people a case study. It's the same idea. It's the same core concepts. But we're giving it, you know, as as a 3rd party. insight is delivered via demonstration. People are saying, Okay, well, it works for James. Then can it works for this other guy, then can it work for me? So the follow up of that content is, you know, show transformation by showing how the transformation is made. The same point that I use in the ultimate case study.

---

## The Insight Funnel & High-Tier Offers

show how. Show the working show how you transform something, how you change something. Show the steps that that person took to actually do it and show as much behind the scenes as you possibly can. These are not testimonials. They're case studies. Testimonials are, hey? It was great to work with him, and it was great to work with her, and it was wonderful. And it's changed my life. These are these the steps this person took? Then we're giving them the offer. The the rule of thumb in an insight funnel is we start high. So we start with our highest tier offer because the economics in a lead based funnel mean that we have to convert at the highest possible economics. So I lead these days with a conversation about one to one, or working for the sovereign circle, because it is an easier conversation to that. And then, if that's not a fit, 5 where they are with me, with finances or their current position in the market. Then I'dinvite them to the syndicate. So that path, you know, if we look at a funnel is Big Idea Video, we're taking them through there. We're giving them the offer. We're offering them our highest tier plan, and then we're downselling them into the into the middle tier. So the insight funnel is, you know, very much straightforward. You put traffic through it again. It can be used equally effectively in in an organic environment as it can to to running ads to it. If you're running ads, I'll add some components later on, which show how you can choose between offering. You know, a gated insight video. So a video where people have to, you know, put an email address in or not. Some of those you know, some benefit from having a gate, and some don't. I prefer these days to run, you know, big ideas or Vsls very much ungated, so people can consume the info and get insight as quickly as possible.

---

## The Customer Funnel (Low-Ticket)

The the second piece is, you know, the customer funnel, and you know, for all intents and purposes it's just a low ticket funnel. It's just a low ticket funnel, but, like, you know. a lot of them, the devil is in the detail. So you know. Step one is obviously you need to run traffic to it. Low ticket funnels, unless you have gigantic, enormous audiences need large amounts of traffic to them, because the the net levels of conversion on the front end to make the economics work just need a lot of eyeballs. And so the the ads these days, you know, there's lots of different forms. I still. I still maintain a few people disagree. I still maintain a long form and a story based ad will work pretty well. Some of the economic, some of the cost per leads, etc, in my, in my Facebook account right now, you know, justify that where a long form story, based Ad. Especially on in Facebook land, still works pretty well to get capture attention and actually convert it. In the other forms that we have now of consumption. You know stories and and vertical video. And these things, then does what it says on the tin ads like, get this for $9. Get this for $5. This is what's inside it. Work extremely well, because they're very kind of snackable and clickable. So people know what they're clicking on because it says it on there. You know how to get high ticket clients without sales calls $9. It's very much it does what it says on the tin.

---

## Ad Creatives & Audiences

The other thing that I've tested with some results, even though it's It's a little bit all over the place, in terms of which ones work. And what kind of creative work is, I've taken, you know, opus clip, or one of those you know, clip chopping kind of services, and use the shorts from the product. So the hybrid offer, for example, has you know. a 2 h long workshop with it. I chuck it in into the into the tool. I get the shorts back, and I use some of the shorts as ads. Most of them are wildly out of context because they're from the middle of a training. But some of them also get traction and actually work to convert, and purchases audiences go big, you know, run, run a big, open audience for the countries that you that you want to target run interests and run warm as well for landing page viewers, for viewers and followers, etc. having those 3 there, you know, you will dial in with the different content types and and find it increasingly. It's a creative game rather than audience game. Once you find the audiences that work, you feed them, you know very good amounts of creative, probably these days assisted with AI creative in terms of you know, that does what it says on the tin imagery. And you know the low ticket offers. So the concept of the Dcm. too, like came from me going? Well, I've got a product. I've got a video that says, basically the same stuff. It's the same ideas. It's the same like, it's actually the same original Google Doc, that started the book that then I can then talk to.

---

## Repurposing Content for Different Buying Types

Why don't I just present them in 2 different ways to for 2 different buying types. So it's fair to say that the big idea video is just essentially the book in video form in terms of consumption. And that's why the the core of the funnel. The same idea can be present in both places. People are just going to consume it in different ways. One way is, you know, the free path. They're going to watch a video. And another way is them investing and buying. You know the media that goes with it. So within that we've also got sub products. You know the the hybrid offer for me and and the trainings that the training that goes in there in the template has worked particularly well in the top of funnel. The components that you know need to be there are pretty straightforward again the headline drives, like most of the activity. And then, as we've gone along, we've called out different people, coaches, consultants, agency owners who sell high ticket services. Give it some credibility exactly what's in it. Give it a guarantee, give it an FAQ. Put some testimonials on the page, but that's only after we've proven the market wants it. and, as I always say, use an asset. You've already got to deploy into a low ticket funnel. The one of the major mistakes are giving too much in the front end. You know what's the rule of one. It's clear they get one valuable thing from the purchase for me. It's clear that they get a template that they can use immediately, even if they're not using it. They have a tool in their toolkit that they that they get access to immediately that they can actually see how someone else is doing it.

---

## Low-Ticket Offer Strategy

Templates Pdfs books. They work, you know, in the one to $10 range bundles of trainings or bundles of templates, or, or, you know, bundling multiple things together. 15 to $30. Live workshops perform particularly well. especially if you've got somewhat of a warm audience, you know 25 to 100 based on your marketplace. And you're aiming for, you know, an 8% front end. Conversion off that page. That's a that's a rule of thumb. Again, it depends on the economics, because the goal of an info funnel is always to get the advertising dollars back as much as you can. The the nice thing about this funnel and as a lot of people have found is that you can have multiple front end offers and then run everything else the same. So I have the same bump across all my front end, low ticket products the Cash campaign. It's complementary to the 1st purchase they make. So it converts very well that converts at over 70% at the moment. So you're aiming for a 50% conversion of the bump. My bump is $29, so it needs to convert at least over 50%. Some people have got good success with a. you know, a $39 bump, and of course you need slightly. You don't need quite as much conversion to make that work. I'vealways found that bumps like order bumps work best in the kind of 24 to $29 range. Again, relative to the market.

---

## Upsells and Membership Offers

The upsell. Take something you've already got and sell it to them. The upsell purely exists to raise the average order value right? So I sell the 3 K code and the social code for $99. That's a big old bundle of training. There's something close to 6 h of stuff in there. To consume. So it's a big old chunk. I think there's a there's a reasonable hypothesis that slows down the purchase of people actually consume it. And so if you notice that you're you know you're getting a lot of upsell sales, but you're not getting a lot lot of back in sales, then your upsell might be, you know, in the this is too good kind of category. I've found that $99 works again. I've I've used upsells that you know, work at 1 99 as well, just just equally there. It purely exists to, you know, increase average order value. Don't include too much stuff, you know don't include a 52 video course in there, as it will slow down the whole purchasing cycle. And you want 20% of people to convert it to convert into it. We can go here straight to a membership offer. We've got a customer there in motion. They're buying information. Let's make a hypothesis that they want more information. So I go straight to a membership coming in at 8, $50 a week, and then they they can come in at $50 a week. Try it out, cancel any time if they like it. They stay. We're aiming for a 20% retention rate off the membership. We don't expect. you know, many people to stay whatsoever, but it gets us customers, and ultimately we can upgrade those customers in the future. You know, and once someone's in motion, and once someone's buying, we want to know what they're going to buy next. So you know, the obvious upsell for me past the membership is buying the syndicate, getting access to me. Excuse me. One thing that they tested early on that that has worked extremely well is that when I'm delivering the product that they've bought, you know, when they've bought the hybrid offer workshop. They've gone through the funnel. If they haven't bought the membership. Then by the time they get to the training I'm offering them a trial. So I'm offering, you know, and quite a few people here joined via that trial. So I've just got a passive call to action around the. And I've given you this template as well around the training that allows people to, you know, join the trial. If they are consuming the training, they like the training. Then saying. Hey, get more of this. That's a very, you know. Congruent place to put it where they can actually trial the membership as they're consuming the product.

## Benefits of the Dual-Mode Funnel

So the the 2.0 funnel, you know, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, you know, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right? You're also getting future buyers and new customers and new clients at a high velocity much higher than nurture based funnels. So cash flow grows as the funnel dials in allowing you to scale marketing, spend faster than a traditional funnel in a traditional funnel. You've got to put leads in the top, have conversations. Wait till you get the client out the other side to understand what's the cost per acquisition, etc, etc. with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that actually feeds the whole system. So I found with these type of funnels running them in conjunction, you can scale them quicker because you are getting cash on the daily basis rather than having to wait 7 or 14 or 30 days to actually get a client out the other side and the other major byproduct is my list that the growth of my email list is predominantly made up of buyers these days. Right? So as my email list grows, I have more and more buyers. If I have more and more buyers on my email list, I get a higher response when I make an offer, because I've already got people on the list who are actually buyers. So the slow, steady, but, you know appreciable, compounding effect which most good things come from that compounds. Today. When I make an offer, I get a much higher response rate than it was than if it was made up from purely leads. I would much rather have a smaller list made up of buyers and customers than a large list made up of people who have just opted into something, and you know I've got the permission to communicate with.

---

## The Two Paths to Customer Acquisition

So the the 2 paths are the key thing, you know, putting the right offers in there. Is the thing that ultimately makes it work over the long term. About 50% of the offers that are put into the customer funnel work. Some of them sell well, but they don't generate clients. Some of them don't sell well, and the economics don't work, but you know. Given a long enough time period, they might generate clients. So it's about, you know, putting offers out there. Understand the buying path and understand that it's 2 different paths that we can get people on. Get people into our world. and both of them complement each other. I've given you all the the page templates there as well. So you've got the product templates and the info and the customer funnel templates, and also the client funnel, which is super simple. Because it's a single page. So the deployment of those is is relatively straightforward. Questions. Insights need help.

## Q&A: VSL Strategy

Jarred Brown: Hi, mate!

James Kemp: Hi jared.

Jarred Brown: The couple of questions. If you don't mind going down the Vsl path a little bit deeper, so correct me if I'm wrong is the these. So. I went through Youtube as you're speaking, you're not linking that as like a call to action inside of your Youtube knows, are you not.

James Kemp: On some videos I am. There's about a dozen videos that I am.

Jarred Brown: Okay.

James Kemp: On the Daily on the daily videos. I'm linking to a membership of.

Jarred Brown: Okay. So that would be like the equivalent of like tacky had a video that he unlisted and sent everyone there is that, like the the equivalent, and, like Dan Bolton, has one front of.

James Kemp: Yeah, you can do it that way if you want to host it on on Youtube.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, or like you said, send them to a page and then have a button where they can directly go to Instagram. Start a conversation with me. Okay, Instagram.

James Kemp: Could sit in your Instagram profile and your Facebook profile. It could sit in your email footer, you know. Ultimately, if you wanted to. If you had an okay size audience and you didn't want to run paid traffic to it. You could still get, you know, 30 to 50 views of that every day right, and get a and get a lead and a conversation, 2 to 3 conversations a day out of that.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, okay, great. And you're just to confirm there's no opt in for that. It's just insight. It's just an inside video that they can watch, and if they find it powerful they can take the next step and go straight to the button.

James Kemp: I I've found my preference. Both work right. My preference is to have a naked Vsl.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, I agree.

James Kemp: The downside to that is, it's harder to run paid traffic to it because you're running it on pure views. And so you have to measure things more robustly on the back end, and and attribution will always be imperfect right? And that's why running a customer funnel that generates cash flow mitigates a lot of that, because you can just run traffic to the page and be less concerned about how many leads and how many how many actual clients are coming out of the specific video because it's harder to measure unless you went. You went super granular, and you have multiple versions of it from different platforms, etc.

Jarred Brown: the option for Vsl, if I'm thinking about sort of how you frame up a Vsl, is it? Maybe me condensing the book and going through the book, or me sort of like doing like a a sort of a basic overview of my my main mechanisms, and why they're important and and how they, you know, is that like, how how do you create a basel? Essentially is what is what I'm saying and what do you put in there.

James Kemp: Oh! How do you present.

Jarred Brown: I present through video. I've got like the book there at the minute. But I think like a a video. My audience seems to consume video.

James Kemp: How do you? What's native to you like? How do you run trainings? How do you turn up? How do you show up.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, video and zoom like what you've got there.

James Kemp: So do you use documents? Do you use.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, like I use. I use slides and ipad, and draw on the ipad and use the ipad to draw like and examples. And then, like like, say, if it's a Rugby League player like, put down on the field where they are and give them practical examples of things. So I typically like to use my ipad and draw and discuss breakdown models.

James Kemp: Okay. yeah. So do exactly that. So break down 3 key mechanisms, show show who they've worked for and then have a call to action at the end.

Jarred Brown: Okay, cool. Okay? And you're just.

James Kemp: When I say it doesn't matter. Everybody here is not running thousands of or hundreds of $1,000 of traffic to these things every day the driver is going to be the headline.

Jarred Brown: Yeah.

James Kemp: And you being comfortable, presenting.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, I'm happy with them. yeah, it's just another. It's like a another version, yeah of the of the boardroom that can sit within my profiles. And I'm comfortable testing initially without the I'm running it naked as well, and just having that call action straight to having a chat.

James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, I mean.

julie williams: We can.

James Kemp: The social. The social world these days, I think, is conducive to that. But the caveat is that it's just harder to run paid traffic to if you want to. because it's harder to measure.

Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah, cool. And also. To your message on Keen. If you can send me that link after. And then will we be going a little bit more deeper, and personalizing this a little bit more obviously in person.

James Kemp: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's good.

Jarred Brown: Perfect.

James Kemp: The fun place to do it, especially eating pasta.

Jarred Brown: Thanks, mate.

James Kemp: Cool.

## Q&A: Funnel Implementation & Testing

julie williams: Hi, Jack, can I jump in here? Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I'm about to listen. I'm just wondering. The back end of all this that you're doing is that in go high level under workflows.

James Kemp: The the funnel templates are there, but they're all high level pages. They're all.

julie williams: Yeah, because I'm working with upwork at the moment on getting out a nurture or a workflow in go high level. So we've got similar to, you know. One offer is to book a call. No one ever books a call, and they don't know you. So from there it then jumps to. I've got a 12 page. Report that outlines what I do with a call to action on the end of that. If they don't, if they take that 12 page report. They still don't do anything. It flips then to the next section of A. My ultimate initial offering is to book in for a 6 week fast track of my bigger 16 week mastermind program. So that's ultimately where I want them to end up. And then I've got a what else have I got? I've got something else in there, if they don't do that. So we're just trying to work them through to take up some offer in that process in go high level, and it's about to be launched into some people I've mined in Linkedin. But I'm just wondering with this. DM. 2 that you do it? Is it? Is that what you called it? Hang on a minute. Yeah. Number 2. Cause I did your 3 K code way back. What is the difference between a nurture campaign or a workflow and your new? This new thing? Can you make it a bit clearer for me? So I don't really understand it. What the difference is, and am I on the right track? Do.

James Kemp: I'm not here. I'm not here to like, educate you on that distinction. If you if you're in motion with something, then it will be a mistake to switch it without testing it. So if you've got that funnel ready to go, put a hundred people through it.

julie williams: But a hundred only I've got about 1,500 at the moment we've accumulated, but I haven't done anything with them at this point, so I'm just a bit unsure. What's gonna happen there? But why, only a hundred.

James Kemp: Just to get some confidence. What happens when a hundred people go through? Yeah, often reflects what happens when a thousand people go through.

julie williams: Right. So he's saying.

James Kemp: Then you know what your level of commitment and investment to it. You know, if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. you know. 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand.

julie williams: Hmm, yeah, right? So continue on the path. I'm going with the workflow. Test it out. But then, how does this fit in here?

James Kemp: It's.

julie williams: This is more about Vsls.

James Kemp: For you right now, Julie. you're you're doing something. This isn't about getting in. I should have. I should have said that caveat at the top like. if you've got something that's working and it's in motion, then put this in the toolbox for later. If you need to come back to it. If you don't have a funnel that's working, and you don't have anything that's on the table that's putting out there. Then this is for you. But when you've got something that's about to go live marketplace, that's all that matters.

julie williams: Yeah. And the other thing I just wanna check is your Google, Doc. Is that sort of taking a back, I know for you. It's not but for us, should I still? Because when I get people to sign up if they sign up for that.

James Kemp: Julie, you've got something that you're about to launch like, get get them on the phone right.

julie williams: Yeah, that's easy to say, but they don't get on the phone. If they don't know you for you, it's easy.

James Kemp: What's that got? What's what's that got statement? Got to do anything.

julie williams: Your assumption.

James Kemp: About people don't getting on the phone. If they don't know you.

julie williams: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

James Kemp: Well, well.

julie williams: It doesn't seem.

James Kemp: Selling, right?

julie williams: No, it's been proven in in like I've been working with Karita, and that for years, and they've been saying it's easy to, because you have a follow up. You tell them a time you do the 5 min before the call. It just doesn't work.

James Kemp: Okay.

julie williams: And so that's why this nurture. If they don't do the call, then we send them to somewhere else in the back end in the go, high level, nurture, workflow sequence.

James Kemp: Test it.

julie williams: Test it alright. Well, I think I've got a call with you next week, so I might pick your brain a bit more. Then what would be.

James Kemp: Bring me, bring me some data.

julie williams: Like, what? Yeah, well, we're not really.

James Kemp: How many people have! How many people have seen the report! How many people have booked a call.

julie williams: Yeah, okay, yep, we're not ready to roll with it yet, because sorry, James, we're not ready to roll just yet. I reckon it'll be in the next 2 weeks. So I might even cancel that call with you next week and rebook it, for when I think it's we're gonna have some.

James Kemp: Data bring me? Got it? Okay? Otherwise, we're sitting in a yeah critical hellscape of what might work could work and preconceived assumptions.

julie williams: Yeah. Right. No worries. Thanks. James.

## Q&A: Info Products vs. Service Offers

James Kemp: Anyone got products. They want to launch and wants to talk through it. or a low ticket, and you know what might work. What have you got in the toolkit?

James Kemp: No, hey, George.

George Fourie: How you doing good. Good, hey, man?

George Fourie: Just something that you brought up.

George Fourie: and I just want a distinction on it. You you mentioned like in your funnel.

George Fourie: you're going from info to info. And so

George Fourie: that obviously helps with the with the congruence of the of the conversion.

George Fourie: What about if it's

George Fourie: like the front end is info. But it's the community, or you know, my office, like my partners, group or something, is, is a bit more, I guess. Service orientated in a way.

George Fourie: Does that still flow in congruence.

James Kemp: If the service is complementary to the last purchase.

George Fourie: Right.

James Kemp: Right.

George Fourie: Yeah, okay, cool. So so I guess it's it's it doesn't really matter. Then, right? Like, if the if the content is

George Fourie: if the service is what the content does.

James Kemp: Yes, I mean info info can be a misnomer. But if you're driving people through

James Kemp: the purchase form like, what is the next? Logical purchase

James Kemp: is the thing that's complementary to the last one.

George Fourie: Yes.

James Kemp: So Justin and Sarah just ran a workshop, right? You know, about a particular Google Strategy.

James Kemp: And so they had a hundred 70 people, or whatever it was, by the workshop.

James Kemp: Then the upsell and the path of buying the workshop.

James Kemp: They're done for you

James Kemp: install with their with their supplier the done for you version of the you're coming to this workshop to learn about this.

James Kemp: Do you want it done for you? That's before the workshop as well.

George Fourie: Gotcha.

James Kemp: And so the service is complementary to the last purchase.

James Kemp: Do you want this done for you as a as a very complimentary, you know. Next thing

James Kemp: you're thinking about the sequence that they're going in the sequence of purchasing to make that natural.

James Kemp: And as you go kind of high ticket, you just want to expose some offers that then you can come back to and offer them later, because they might not sell on the 1st run through.

George Fourie: Cool, so so on that I'm curious. How are you finding? So you've got all these $9 offers

George Fourie: running? How are you finding that community upsell that that you included in that in the funnel.

George Fourie: like to the like, your community level? And do you do you just do to community level? Or do you do like

George Fourie: $9 to sovereign, to the syndicate as well.

James Kemp: I I would. I'm doing that manually like if someone's joining the community, I'm starting to reach out to them to, you know. Understand that. But my focus was getting the

James Kemp: the front end working, if you like, getting people to purchase memberships and then

James Kemp: upselling, and then retention like in that order.

George Fourie: Gotcha, and in just last lost on that, are you seeing?

George Fourie: So you got $9 offer? Go straight, for

George Fourie: I think I saw it this way. Just correct me. So you got $9 offer. Go straight for like 50 bucks a week, or that annual sort of upsell 9 90. I think it was. And then on the training you downselled with a

George Fourie: like 9 for 9 or something like that, like, yeah. So the.

James Kemp: The annual works, but it only works to people who know me.

George Fourie: Yeah.

James Kemp: And so it's deceptive because it works to warm traffic.

James Kemp: So then the funnel looks like it's working. But then that doesn't scale.

James Kemp: So the $50.

James Kemp: The $50 a week works to code traffic.

James Kemp: If they don't buy that, then by the time they get to the the training. They're offered the 9, the $9 trial.

James Kemp: $9 for 9 days.

George Fourie: Gotcha!

George Fourie: Alright cool.

George Fourie: cool.

George Fourie: Thanks for that.

James Kemp: So it's in totality. It's a $9 front end, a $29 bump.

James Kemp: a $99 upsell a membership offer.

James Kemp: and then a membership trial as a downsell.

James Kemp: It's the sequence.

George Fourie: Gotcha got it.

James Kemp: And once all those things are working in harmony. Then you're getting, you know.

James Kemp: a decent amount amount of members, and they just want to retain them.

George Fourie: Like it. Awesome. Thank you.

## Q&A: Low-Ticket Offer Performance & Ad Strategy

James Kemp: Adam, did you have something.

Adam Franklin: I did. I've got a lot of things going through my head. James. I guess you might have covered, and I did come late, so I'll watch the recording. Are you finding that there's certain offers that perform best for that initial

Adam Franklin: advert that you're running in that $9 type of product

Adam Franklin: like, is it training, or is it like a

Adam Franklin: a Gpt or a tool that can get them going faster.

James Kemp: Yep. So 3 basic categories is like a template or something someone can use immediately.

James Kemp: They work kind of under 10 bucks, impulse, purchase bundles of templates or trainings work

James Kemp: kind of up to 30 bucks

James Kemp: and then live workshops work particularly well because they're time-based.

James Kemp: you know, so they've got and built scarcity. And they work, you know, from kind of 25 to a hundred.

James Kemp: Live workshops are just tougher on

James Kemp: to launch and deploy on an ad basis, because if you go too far out, then you're running ads too early and you're wasting ad spend.

James Kemp: But if you try and wait too close. Then you don't get

James Kemp: the velocity, and your your ads can just get stuck

James Kemp: and don't actually get distribution, so that there are. They work extremely well. That is tough

James Kemp: to do on a on to use on ads. So they work they work better as a

James Kemp: as maybe a regular thing. If you had the the same thing running, you know, every week, or every fortnight or every month.

Adam Franklin: Got it and is, is setting up the ads and the time, because I've often been a bit scared of ads, and it can often take a lot of money and a lot of time to get them dialed in right. Do you find that there's a big, expensive learning curve, or is it quite straightforward now, with

Adam Franklin: with with adverts.

James Kemp: Mean, the wrong offer will always be expensive.

Adam Franklin: Sure.

James Kemp: So the adds, a

James Kemp: ads are as challenging as they ever have been. I think the the biggest advantages we have now is

James Kemp: we can test and deploy an Mvp. Of like a landing page or something really quickly. So I will start with a minimum viable landing page where it's a headline.

James Kemp: It's bullet points. It's a buy button.

James Kemp: and that's it. If you get some purchases, then you start adding everything else to it

James Kemp: but that the template that I've given you is the

James Kemp: the one that you can deploy quickly.

James Kemp: because it's just got all the components like a guarantee proof faqs.

James Kemp: etc, etc, headline sub headline, the ads.

James Kemp: They need a little bit of luck as well.

James Kemp: and you know, when we 1st launched, when we relaunched the book.

James Kemp: It was like, why isn't this working? Because this has worked really well.

James Kemp: and it took a few weeks of like putting ads up, taking them down trying audiences, and then it just it kind of took off.

James Kemp: And so what you find is that you can.

James Kemp: It's healthy to. It's healthy to follow urine. I'm like, I know, the book works and things haven't magically changed. So we're gonna we're just gonna put it on the shelf for a bit and then come back to it.

James Kemp: And then, when the algorithm kind of like, you know, gives you the gift

James Kemp: and it works in the 1st few days, then it keeps going, and then you can feed it with creative.

James Kemp: But it needs to. It needs something needs to happen in the 1st 72 h.

James Kemp: Otherwise you just may as well pull it all down and start again.

Adam Franklin: Right? Okay, so don't keep persevering. If there's not much traction in those 1st 3 days.

James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, you know, just give it a rest. Come back with maybe some different angles and different creative.

James Kemp: you know. And and I'm talking about offers that you that you know, work or should work, and.

Adam Franklin: Has it worked with your list?

James Kemp: They've worked before, or someone else has got them working right.

James Kemp: You know there are. There's an offer out there that's like yours.

James Kemp: you know, with a slightly different twist on it that you see, and it's been running for a long time, and you go and look, and that the ads are months old or those things. And you're like, Okay, I can get that working.

James Kemp: You're just looking for the angle

James Kemp: mine. The hybrid offer especially needed

James Kemp: needed a frame of who it was, for before it would really

James Kemp: catch right? It was working.

James Kemp: but I didn't have the. This is for these people. This is for coaches is for consultants is for agency, and as soon as that was in the, in the copy and in the framing. Then the cost per the cost per acquisition dropped a lot and the the funnel was working. It's just the the acquisition was a little bit too high to go too far

James Kemp: while while the while the actual funnel is working. So it just need a little frame of who it's for.

Adam Franklin: And so that's where you landed on coach consultant agency owner.

James Kemp: Yeah.

Adam Franklin: Okay.

James Kemp: You were

James Kemp: You are going to spend money testing.

Adam Franklin: Yeah.

James Kemp: Right.

Adam Franklin: And what's a reasonable amount if something looks at sort of 50 bucks a day? Is that a reasonable amount in your experience, or should it be higher or lower.

James Kemp: I think you could.

James Kemp: You know I start with $500, but I can do that right. I don't think that thinking in a daily in a daily

James Kemp: way is like particularly healthy because it's arbitrary.

James Kemp: I I like the frame of.

James Kemp: If I set this $2,000 on fire, would it materially affect me?

James Kemp: And if the answer is no, then that's how much you should spend on testing your funnel.

Adam Franklin: Got it over. What timeframe would you say so? It's say it's an arbitrary $1,000 or $2,000 that you're prepared to test.

James Kemp: Yeah, I'm gonna spend. I'm gonna spend 3 weeks doing this. I'm going to spend $2,000. And then at the end, I'm going to see what happens. I would have learned something. I would have looked at everything along the way.

Adam Franklin: Okay. And that's something that you tend to do yourself. Or do you have a agency or a partner that that looks over.

James Kemp: I'll always get a funnel going myself. And then nowadays the creative demands of

James Kemp: The creative demands of the funnel are just something I don't want to deal with. So I get someone to take over. And you know, media buying these days is

James Kemp: moved away from like which audiences do you choose to. How much creative can you feed it into the right audiences?

James Kemp: So you need someone who's going to produce reasonable high level like, we're we're launching new ads every Monday.

Adam Franklin: Right?

Adam Franklin: Are you finding Facebook and Instagram, or the platforms? Or do you go broader than that in your own personal experience?

James Kemp: I mean, Meta is, Meta has just got

James Kemp: unlimited amounts of people to to go to. Right? Yeah. And so

James Kemp: the creative requirements are still relatively low. You can do static ads with text. You can do video, you know. So Youtube and those those platforms just have a higher creative requirement and a higher and a higher learning curve for most people.

James Kemp: So those require more investment.

Adam Franklin: Okay.

Adam Franklin: And then the resources you put in the in the in the Google, Doc, I don't suppose you could copy that link in again, or I can just wait for the for the replay. But those you said you did do it in high level are those

Adam Franklin: pages and templates that you've shared? Are they like snapshots we can install? Or do we just sort of go in and and replicate them ourselves on our end?

James Kemp: That's a that's a snapshot you can install in Ghl.

Adam Franklin: Oh, great, fabulous! Thank you!

## Q&A: The Importance of Differentiation & Creativity

James Kemp: The the creative. We've talked about this a bit. And you know, office hours and the circle calls this week is the creative requirement.

Adam Franklin: And these categories and the businesses that we're in.

James Kemp: Isn't just the things people look at and images and those things. It's creative. Requirement is is differentiation.

James Kemp: Bye, the barriers to entry in almost every

James Kemp: coaching, consulting agency services category have just dropped into the floor.

James Kemp: Anyone can do and say whatever they like on the Internet. And this means that people have

James Kemp: fatigue on a lot of different levels. They have offer fatigue, they have face fatigue, they have idea, fatigue.

James Kemp: and the the crazier you are the easier it is now, because you will

James Kemp: see and do, and feel and say and present things that other people don't have access to, and

James Kemp: the one of the declines in performance of advertising is because the speed to copy everybody else is just ramped up to infinity. Right as soon as you launch something good. If people are watching you, someone else will launch almost the identical thing.

James Kemp: and that will

James Kemp: it does. It has a dual. It's a duality like it educates the market. And so maybe it's good, but it also induces fatigue in the market because they're seeing the same idea.

James Kemp: said the same way by different people. And they people just get blindness right?

James Kemp: And so the creative requirement

James Kemp: that the burden on all of us now is to be different right? And the irony

James Kemp: is that kind of the more time you spend in places like this, the more time you spend looking at what your friends, colleagues, peers, competitors, and those things are, are doing, the harder it is to be creative.

Adam Franklin: And.

James Kemp: Over over time for me.

James Kemp: My best ideas have come from adjacent markets, or taking b 2 c ideas to b 2 b, or taking concepts, and you know one plus one equals 9 by taking concepts from different places and introducing them into the marketplaces and the places you operate in.

James Kemp: which is all to say.

James Kemp: The more you try and follow.

James Kemp: I understand. That's why I always try and present the principles and the thinking behind these things rather than just. This is what to do.

James Kemp: Because if you just stick on, the this is what to do, and these are the tactics. And this is what to say, and those things

James Kemp: that it won't work by default because

James Kemp: everybody else is saying it, and everybody else is doing it, and everybody else is saying it in exactly the same way.

James Kemp: and you know

James Kemp: some of the measures that people have to take, especially sensitive people who kind of absorb everything and are looking at what everybody else is doing.

James Kemp: Some of the measures that people have to take to kind of deprogram themselves from of doing the same thing in the same way, and saying the same stuff, and then getting annoyed that it doesn't work are kind of extreme.

James Kemp: So we do, which is all to say, understand the principles, follow the the pattern, but introduce

James Kemp: your own process to it. Your own, you know, essence to it, and and those things, and

James Kemp: I'm kind of increasingly reluctant to

James Kemp: in many ways give scripts. And what exactly do I say in this? And what exactly do I say in that?

James Kemp: Because if I'm giving them to 100 people at once.

James Kemp: I'm just further perpetuating there their

James Kemp: the the averageness, because that's that's what it returns to in the mean.

James Kemp: And so the creative requirement isn't just. You know. What do you put out there?

James Kemp: It's, you know, truly, genuinely, having new takes different angles on same concepts, which is

James Kemp: kind of tough. A few

James Kemp: set it all week at your computer all day, and that's the you know. The only way that

James Kemp: you kind of replicate these things in your or you're looking at everybody else.

## Q&A: Identity vs. Outcome in Marketing

Adam Franklin: Are you still finding that it's the identity that people are

Adam Franklin: buying into as well when it comes to, offers the identity that they can become more so than the the skill that they're acquiring, or the sort of specific outcome that they're acquiring?

Adam Franklin: Or is the identity part of tied into it baked into it, but less explicit.

James Kemp: I think this is where the depth of like power laws is much deeper than how much money people will give you, and how much they'll invest

James Kemp: is is what's their transformational type? Right?

James Kemp: There are.

James Kemp: There are a tiny number of people.

James Kemp: but like proportionately in each category. Who are, we'll invest into transformation based

James Kemp: programs and engagements and coaching and true mentorship

James Kemp: because they understand proximity is how

James Kemp: changes my name. Who am I around what environment I'm in, not like, what am I being taught?

James Kemp: There's is a very large cohort of people who are still stuck

James Kemp: in the information age. Right? If I just get more information and buy more information. Then I'll have some kind of breakthrough

James Kemp: right?

James Kemp: And so the nature of how people buy and why they buy

James Kemp: hasn't really kind of changed. Just our ability to differentiate between those people kind of has. And this is where it's useful to understand what you're selling to people.

James Kemp: A lot of people don't want coaching and don't want new skills.

James Kemp: They just want to be plugged in

James Kemp: to the matrix and just given all this stuff.

James Kemp: There's a there's a a number of people who

James Kemp: can't not do it, and they will buy transformation and coaching and masterminds. And

James Kemp: that's just what they do right.

James Kemp: I don't really care who is in a mastermind. I care who's in it.

James Kemp: I don't care who what I'm going to be taught, I mean. I care who I get to hang around, you know, and who I get to be near, because that's where the that's where true transformation kind of happens or true insight happens.

James Kemp: So yeah, I think there's

James Kemp: there'll be. There's a return in many ways, memberships,

James Kemp: masterminds, and people who understand proximity, and people who don't, who'll buy info

James Kemp: identity is and mature markets, and or will always transcend

James Kemp: strategic or or outcome-based promises over time, because

James Kemp: how many times have you seen

James Kemp: make a hundred KA month?

James Kemp: How many times have you say 19 KA month?

James Kemp: How many times have you seen that you see it to the point where it loses all meaning.

James Kemp: and so identity, and who someone who someone becomes will transcend that over the long, over the long term?

James Kemp: Who do you want to be.

Adam Franklin: As sorry

Adam Franklin: that identity is more more than just about the dollars. Is it.

James Kemp: Always. Yeah.

James Kemp: Molester.

Adam Franklin: Cool.

Adam Franklin: Thank you.

James Kemp: Yeah, the money and different types can always be used, as you know, helps to get attention.

James Kemp: But over over the long term.

James Kemp: the underlying question that most people have is, Who will I become if I, if I

James Kemp: put my beliefs into this and and ultimately invest in it.

Adam Franklin: Thank you.

## Q&A: Workshopping a Product Idea (DCM)

James Kemp: Hi, Tom.

Tom Rolley: Hey, James, how's it going.

James Kemp: Good.

Tom Rolley: I was wondering if we could workshop a potential product through the Dcm

Tom Rolley: and just see how you'd approach that. So the essentially, it's a workshop recording. It was called Map your custom journey, and the purpose was to identify the constraint in the business so that they would know which thing to fix

Tom Rolley: so yeah, just wondering how you'd approach that from A from this? Dcm, like, where do I? Where do I start? What do I build. How do I? How do I look at it to get it up? And running.

James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have.

James Kemp: So do does the target market know what a customer journey is.

Tom Rolley: Oh, gee, maybe. But probably not

Tom Rolley: they. Yeah, I'm guessing they probably they're probably just overwhelmed with the amount of stuff going on in their business, and they probably wouldn't recognize that those words.

James Kemp: So in the in the realm of the customer. What's the primary problem that they want solved like today?

Tom Rolley: I think, like they're probably they're they're looking for either, like increased profits or increased revenue. And then they're not sure like what they're trying lots of things, but nothing much is working. And they're just like unsure about what even the problem is is most likely.

James Kemp: Exactly.

James Kemp: That market category isn't good for info products. They're good for insight.

James Kemp: Right? Once you catch their attention, you can, you know, show how how to work those things out. And how do you get your top 3 priorities and actually get them a plan?

James Kemp: But they're not good, for info

James Kemp: info is good for people who already have

James Kemp: something that they feel they need to solve. They're just looking for the the mechanism to do it.

Tom Rolley: Okay. So hence, if they don't know what a customer journey is, then it doesn't make any sense for them to to.

James Kemp: So the way to frame like a customer related journey thing is like how to get.

James Kemp: how to get the the template, to send to your customers today to get 81% back into your business in the next 30 days. Right?

James Kemp: Because they've you know the the repeat business. The instant. Repeat business, template.

James Kemp: how to send this, get clients.

James Kemp: get money, etc. It's easy. It's like, Okay.

James Kemp: I want more repeat business. So I'm going to buy this, so I can use it straight away.

Tom Rolley: Okay? And and that's the insight one rather than the.

James Kemp: That's an info like.

Tom Rolley: That's the info. Okay, cool.

James Kemp: With with the hybrid offer. I'm saying to people, you're selling an expensive thing on the telephone right now take this template. Put the thing you're selling into into this and sell it without the call.

James Kemp: And they're like, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer.

James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't like.

James Kemp: They're doing sales calls.

Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing like, should I just

Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin.

James Kemp: Element of the customer journey. It sounds very high level rather than you know.

Tom Rolley: So that I mean the the outcome is they can see the each stage of their business, and then they can clear. They ordered it and go. Oh, okay, well, we're dropping off here. You know that that there was, you know, 8 18 people going into a sales call and one sale being made, and they were expecting like a 30%. And so it was clear that that was the broken bit.

Tom Rolley: So what do they do about that about one of them that I do.

James Kemp: What do they do?

Tom Rolley: What do they do? Well, then, they it's been mixed up

Tom Rolley: piece rather than fixing more leads or more advertising that it was like, oh, this is this is the broken bit fix that. So they they knew which bit to fix rather than just.

James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this.

Tom Rolley: Okay.

James Kemp: So it talks that a good info product talks to a known problem.

Tom Rolley: Okay? All right. So they have to know the problem that they've got the problem first.st And then they're like, Okay, cool. This, this is the solve.

James Kemp: Yeah. Otherwise, otherwise, an info product is going to spend a lot of time trying to educate people

James Kemp: on that. This is the problem rather than just buying it.

James Kemp: So an info product works best on a market where the the knowledge of the problem is already there.

Tom Rolley: Okay.

James Kemp: An insight as different because that customer journey piece

James Kemp: may work very well as an insight based video which, like, watch this. And then you'll analyze this, and then I'll help you with

James Kemp: help you with fixing that problem.

James Kemp: Okay, cool. Got it

James Kemp: in terms of the like. If you want to know how to use that specific thing.

James Kemp: That's how you'd. That's how you'd utilize it.

Tom Rolley: Okay, so that would be more like the Vsl, the open Vsl piece that you discussed. Okay, cool. All right. Got it.

James Kemp: And then framing it. You know

James Kemp: how we get how we double the revenue from existing customer bases without getting any new leads and and spending money on marketing, or something like that.

Tom Rolley: So yeah, got it. Got it?

Tom Rolley: Alright. Cool.

James Kemp: Because.

Tom Rolley: Thank you.

James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains.

James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them.

James Kemp: whereas info funnel is like, you've got a problem.

James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem.

James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem

James Kemp: would. I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. Hey? Do you want help solving all these problems at once? We should work together.

Tom Rolley: And daily client machine is only info, or

Tom Rolley: is it inside as well like, can you like.

James Kemp: The new way of doing it. You know you're delivering those things both of those things at once, because they complement each other.

James Kemp: The old way of doing it was like, you know, generating a lead, then trying to liquidate the customer, etc. But you only get one buying type

James Kemp: right, you know. And my.

James Kemp: I've got high level clients who have come through both paths. They've watched videos. They've reached out to me

James Kemp: right. And then I've got people who just bought and bought and bought and bought until we had the conversation of like, Hey, do you just want to stop buying stuff and actually work together

James Kemp: same people, but the path that they came through was distinct in terms of who they were, how they bought, and some people flick between different buying types based on timing in different ways, and some people only buy that certain way.

James Kemp: Alright.

James Kemp: I know people who never ever buy info products.

James Kemp: and they won't buy any high ticket that way. And I also people who will not get on a call won't talk to someone won't watch a video that's longer than 30 seconds, and we'll just buy info products all day long and then go. I'm going to hire you for this.

James Kemp: Right? They're different buying paths.

Tom Rolley: Okay. Cool.

James Kemp: And if we only use one of them, then we're limited on.

James Kemp: We're limited on a few fronts, and

James Kemp: where we are in terms of marketplace and maturity. And those things. It's it's it's pretty difficult to

James Kemp: to grow and scale things when you're

James Kemp: when you're limited, not understanding the

James Kemp: what, what what is actually taking place.

Tom Rolley: Okay, cool, cool. Yeah. So basically building for both of those buying styles

Tom Rolley: and then not eliminating the other one.

Tom Rolley: Yeah, cool. Okay.

James Kemp: Anymore, for anymore.

Tom Rolley: Siobhan's got her hand up. I don't know whether you can see that one, but.

James Kemp: I cannot.

Tom Rolley: It's just showing on mine.

James Kemp: Got a question. Siobhan.

## Q&A: Organic vs. Paid Ad Messaging

Shevaune Ray: Yep,

Shevaune Ray: congrats to Tom for pronouncing my name correctly. 1st of all. I just had a quick one, and sorry I'm out getting ice cream. I didn't think I'd actually get on.

Shevaune Ray: So you were saying that with paid ads when you started differentiating who you were talking to by saying, like coaches versus consultants, that

Shevaune Ray: your paid ad spend bent down when you're using these in an organic way, or with your existing audience, did it convert better when you did that as well.

James Kemp: No.

Shevaune Ray: Okay.

James Kemp: But that's self-fulfilling, right? Because the majority of my audience I've already got as

James Kemp: self-selected by being those people. Anyway.

James Kemp: Yeah, I don't tend to Co. In content. I don't tend to speak to a specific category or identity too much. But in ads, you know, they're showing them to so many different people

James Kemp: right? The filter that you go past it like is this for me, has to be a lot more explicit and standing out in in most cases.

Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's it's something I've been playing with in my

Shevaune Ray: wording. And how I speak to people. I it's so all over the place. Sometimes when I'm targeting

Shevaune Ray: and I'm not specific, I can convert like crazy. Sometimes

Shevaune Ray: those saying the same things just doesn't do anything, and I don't know if it's the market, or it's me, or it's how I'm saying it. But I have realized that

Shevaune Ray: I need to unbundle my products more because I was doing exactly what you were just talking about, which they solved a problem. Everybody was really happy, but they didn't want to really do more work because it solved it for too long.

Shevaune Ray: and then they would go off, and like they'd be happy for so long that I was like, Well.

Shevaune Ray: I'm nurturing you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm trying to sell you more things, and they were just like, no, I'm I'm good like I'm good now.

Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one like high ticket thing, and they were good for like a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients.

James Kemp: That's the paradox of some work. Is that

James Kemp: doing a good job actually limits the lifetime value of a client.

Shevaune Ray: And ultimately they can't actually act on

Shevaune Ray: all of it, either. They just feel like they are, because they have all the information.

James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there, in most cases, most people just want relief from how they feel what they're feeling today.

James Kemp: That.

Shevaune Ray: And that's.

James Kemp: And their drive and their will to

James Kemp: transcend their current limitations is actually quite limited.

Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is

Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference.

James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist like we could run low ticket info funnels, you know, forever. And then we'll just reach

James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way.

James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, you know, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long.

James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style.

Shevaune Ray: Chat too.

James Kemp: And the you know I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel.

James Kemp: you know. I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, you know, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than you know. Oh, my God! The webinars, you know, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3.

James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different.

James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product, you know. But.

Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can kind of set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out.

James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah. You know, once, once the

James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's like, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And you know, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, you know, and on an increasingly, you know.

James Kemp: quick basis, right? And

James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, you know, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products.

James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well.

James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're kind of tough to convert, because you've you've kind of given every everybody, everything they needed.

James Kemp: And you've you've actually got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the.

Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about?

Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting?

James Kemp: Not today.

Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay?

Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I kind of stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because

Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And

Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that

Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very like a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket.

Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed.

James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there's there's fatigue all over right, because it's the same stuff

James Kemp: largely propagated by the same people.

James Kemp: And you know, people have gone around it, and so

James Kemp: they've they've come around and come back to the beginning and like, well, what now?

James Kemp: I still don't have the things I want. I'm still not the person I want to be. I'm still not getting the results. I want to be. What now.

Shevaune Ray: And that's I'm trying to tap into that and get my messaging around that exact thing because I've identified it. But it's

Shevaune Ray: what part of that gets people to take action and move instead of just making them more depressed and not want to do anything. So that's that's what I've been playing with in your bundling and unbundling video, the client or customers to clients.

Shevaune Ray: And the daily client machine has been, I just keep going back to those and saying, Okay, I'm going to

Shevaune Ray: found something different in there. I'm going to change this around. I'm going to do that. And I think I'm gonna

Shevaune Ray: sit with the templates from this, and really go to town on it.

James Kemp: Yeah, when when things are.

James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think you know, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's

James Kemp: sometimes working or not working, there's nothing consistent.

James Kemp: Then return back to 1st principles, which is like, get a customer

James Kemp: like, what are we in the business of getting customers.

James Kemp: But you know most things are downstream from that.

James Kemp: And it. It just so happens that the nature of

James Kemp: online marketing and these things which are, you know, under 10 years old.

James Kemp: Everybody went to get a high ticket client, and

James Kemp: not appreciating that there were a particular set of circumstances where that worked really really well.

James Kemp: because we combined high ticket and high margin with high scale and cheap traffic.

Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's for me. I was basically selling

Shevaune Ray: a high ticket customer offer. And I thought I had like cracked the code. I thought I was doing amazing, because most of my month was free, and I only had to sell 4 people to be making a lot of money. And I was like I did it. I figured out the thing. This is the smartest thing ever. No, because as soon as as soon as the market shifts

Shevaune Ray: all those leads dry up, and you have to keep selling and selling and selling every month. And where do they go after they work with you? There's nowhere to put them.

Shevaune Ray: and they're not in your world.

James Kemp: It's hard to sell recurring products when there's no recurring problems.

James Kemp: And some people have recurring product problems where they just don't identify them.

James Kemp: whereas other people genuinely don't have recurring problems, and so recurring

James Kemp: and building, recurring or building reoccurring things depend on those things reoccurring and

James Kemp: over a long enough timeframe. Most things do but

James Kemp: over a short time frame, which is what a lot of people are operating on. They they don't.

James Kemp: And so if a client doesn't need you for a year.

James Kemp: You have to either deal with that reality.

James Kemp: or, you know, work out what, how, how to, how to bridge that across it.

Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that was, that was my hardest thing was to turn what I was doing as a 1 time thing into a yearly offer, because I was so associated with doing it faster, doing it all in one thing I give you all the stuff, and that was actually how I found you. It was a year and a half ago

Shevaune Ray: I found you because a coach that I was interviewing with potentially to hire him. Mentioned your work, and I went and looked up your work, and I ended up not hiring him and jumping into your stuff instead.

James Kemp: Thank you to whoever. That was

James Kemp: one of one of the things that one of the things to think about in terms of time. I was at a mastermind the other weekend and a guy stood up, and he was

James Kemp: a presentation of voice coach right? And he worked with Ceos, and he said, I'm trying to sell

James Kemp: something that I can do with these people for a year.

James Kemp: but they only need me 2 to 3 times a year when they have big presentations, keynotes, and these things.

James Kemp: and what we did in real time was, we like, separated their immediate needs.

James Kemp: and then their consistent long-term needs right.

James Kemp: And what he's done is essentially given people a year-long membership.

James Kemp: and then across the year they can check in with them and have a 14 day sprints that lead up to his, their keynote, or them or their big event, and essentially, they'll schedule them in, you know, a few months ahead of time.

James Kemp: So he's selling

James Kemp: a combination, a hybrid of a membership, and coaching

James Kemp: across the year and and allowing them to finance it, which increases is revenue per customer, but it also makes it more predictable.

James Kemp: So understanding the products we have and the modalities and and getting into the marketplace is like, if people don't need us or want us all the time. Then we have to think, okay, what can what baseline access can they get to keep them in my world? And then, you know, when? When do they need me. And and what's the best way to deliver this product?

James Kemp: And so thinking in a nonlinear way is useful because most people think in terms of like

James Kemp: every week. I'm going to do this with clients, and then every month I'm going to do this with clients. But

James Kemp: most things don't work like that some things do right, you know, lead generation, and those kind of things are conducive to monthly rhythms. But a lot of client work

James Kemp: kind of sits on this wave where they need you a lot for a few weeks a year.

James Kemp: and they don't need you really much at all, but they kind of benefit from being around you, or having access to to those things.

Shevaune Ray: Yeah, you said that in one of your trainings, and actually it like blew my mind, and I immediately changed the membership that I have to where

Shevaune Ray: they get like I do voice notes every day, because that's easy for me. I just have thoughts, and I put them in there. They get modules, and then I just give them calls when they need it. And I was explaining this to my clients that that's how I do it. And they were like every single person was like, Oh, my God! That's too much! Every person would be calling me. They would all be getting on. They'd all want, like.

Shevaune Ray: what I found is that out of every 100 people you maybe have 20 who are engaged, and of the 20 that are engaged you have 3 that actually want to get on a call with you. The rest are just happy to pay.

Shevaune Ray: just to be there.

James Kemp: Yeah, exactly.

James Kemp: I think a lot of people just will pay for the knowledge that they can access something when they need it or access someone when they need it.

Shevaune Ray: And half the time they don't even access the information. They just sit there. That's been the biggest thing for me is to watch.

Shevaune Ray: Once I transitioned over to school, too, so I can see who's watching what and who's using what

Shevaune Ray: a lot of people will be in there, and they'll they'll be like so excited that you drop new modules, and then they never watch them. But they're still excited, and they talk about.

James Kemp: Yep, it's all a it's all understanding, you know. State of preferences and actual preferences right?

James Kemp: And what people are buying.

James Kemp: Enjoy your ice cream.

Shevaune Ray: It's very good ice cream. It's mango and vanilla.

James Kemp: Excellent.

Shevaune Ray: And then Beta into 12.
