# Daily Client Machine Builder Tool

## Overview

The Daily Client Machine (DCM) Builder is a comprehensive tool that helps coaches, consultants, and agency owners create their complete DCM 2.0 funnel system. This tool guides users through defining all elements of their DCM and generates high-converting copy for all 8 funnel pages.

## What is the Daily Client Machine?

The DCM 2.0 is a dual-mode funnel system created by James Kemp that combines:

1. **INSIGHT PATH (Client Funnel)**: Free content → Big Idea Video → Case Study → High-ticket offer
2. **INFO PATH (Customer Funnel)**: Paid ads → Low-ticket product ($9-29) → Order bump → Upsell → Membership

This system allows you to generate both clients AND customers daily, creating multiple revenue streams while building your audience.

## How the Tool Works

- Core Concept & Audience
- Problems & Solutions  
- Product Stack (front-end, bump, upsell, membership)
- Results & Proof
- Content & Messaging

### 2. Intelligent Question Flow
- Questions build upon previous answers
